This project is a PoC for getting currently running title info from an og xbox into your discord client<br>
so your friends on discord can see the games you are playing on your og xbox, the same way they can see games you are playing on pc or current xbox.<br>
This project is Proof of Concept as we have the "Server" setup, the software that takes the title id and tells discord that you are playing xbox,<br>
but we don't have the "client" software setup yet, the how do we get the currently running title info out of your xbox done yet.
